# Spotify Requests with Async Rust

Built a small tool with the crate reqwest that prints to the screen the names of the songs of the newly released albums in Spotify.

APIs:

- https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-new-releases
- https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-albums-tracks

### Motivation

Learn the basics of Rust async/await and the Rust toolchain.
